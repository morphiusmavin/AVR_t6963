test_write_data.c is used to test sending sample data to the AVR. It can also be used to test the sending/receiving<br />
of data to another linux box (with serial cables connected). One one box run 'test_data' with no params to read,<br />
and on the other, run 'test_data <iters> <starting rpm value> <starting value for all others><br />
