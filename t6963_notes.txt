Special character codes sent by the PIC24:

0xFF->0xF0 - PIC24 is sending a sequence of predetermined bytes that are shifted, scaled or 
			bytes combined to make words and displayed at a list of predetermined 
			row,col locations

Special characters sent by AVR to the PIC24:
0xFF - tells PIC24 to start sending a new predetermined sequence of values followed by param
0xFE -> 0xF0 - tells PIC24 to update a certain param followed by param # and value (1 or 2 bytes)
			the PIC24 can send that param to the TS-5500 if it applies.

bytes sent to represent keypresses
0xE0 - '#'
0xE1 - '*'
0xE2 - '0'
0xE3 - '1'
0xE4 - '2'
0xE5 - '3'
0xE6 - '4'
0xE7 - '5'
0xE8 - '6'
0xE9 - '7'
0xEA - '8'
0xEB - '9'
0xEC - 'A'
0xED - 'B'
0xEE - 'C'
0xEF - 'D'

When the PIC24 sends a byte in the range of 0xE0 -> 0xEF that will be interpreted as
a keypress. The dialog will filter this out using a switch statement. The default will
just return whatever was passed in. 

When the PIC24 sends a byte in the range of 0xF0 -> 0xFF that will be interpreted as
a special command to do something like hide the menu or update the display RT values.

The dispSetCursor function will set whatever row,col to a blinking cursor but
the dispCharAt function will display the char passed to it at its row,col parameters
regardless of where the blinking cursor is. When the a number is entered at the cursor
and/or the cursor is moved, the main loop will have to restore the current row,col used
by the RT display.

When the PIC24 sends a keypress it will reset the ESOS delay used by the task that is currently
sending data using the 0xFE command so that there won't be any overlapping of data. It can
also use semaphores to wait till the current sequence is finished before sending a keypress.

So the number enter dialog will use the '#' and the 'D' keys to move the cursor left or
right (resp). The any number key pressed will put the number in the space where the cursor
is. The current row,col used by the dialog is stored in the global variable cur_row, cur_col
and the number is in cur_global_number[10]. The dialog updates what's in new_global_number
and if the user cancels out, the new_global_number is reset. If the user hits 'Enter', the
cur_global_number is updated with new_global_number providing the new number is within
limits. 

Screen Layout:

typedef struct prompts
{
	uint8_t pnum;
	UCHAR row;
	UCHAR col;
    uint16_t offset;
	int len;
    uint8_t type;
} PROMPT_STRUCT;

eeprom_burn.c will record the initial 5 different types of screen layouts to eeprom and then
later on we can add a dialog which lets the user change the screen layout to suit.
RT_LAYOUT_STRUCT in RT_MAIN should be a pointer to a malloc'd list of RT_LAYOUT_STRUCT's.
num_params will be the number of params used. A function called update_layouts will fill the
ram space with all the RT_MAIN layouts and then all the RT_LAYOUT_STRUCT's. Then this function
will record it all to eeprom with the no_layouts next to no_prompts and prompt_info_offset at
0x03f4 in eeprom. (no_prompts is at 0x03f0 (byte) and prompt_info_offset is at 0x03f2 (word).

Special chars sent by PIC24:

The PIC24 sends a sequence of chars starting with one of the RT_TYPES. Each RT_TYPE is followed
by a DATA_TYPE which tells the AVR what kind of data to expect. All the data is sent as UCHAR
except for RT_RPM which is a UINT. If the data sent as a UCHAR is < 0x7f (127) the data type
will be RT_LOW. If the high bit is set (> 0x7f) the data type will be RT_HIGH0. If a UINT is 
set without the high bit for the first or second byte the data type will be RT_HIGH1. RT_HIGH2
has bit 7 set and RT_HIGH3 has bit 15 set. The AVR will then know by the data type sent just
after the RT_TYPE how to format the data (adding the appropriate high bit back in before printing
it to the screen. The reason for this is so it can filter out the keypresses (0xE0->0xEF).

key is pressed the context will return to the previous menu. (the only exception to this
is the main menu).
